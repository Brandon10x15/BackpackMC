## BackpackMC

BackpackMC adds personal, configurable backpacks to Minecraft servers. Players get a persistent inventory they can open via command or a shortcut item, with options for auto-pickup, sorting, previews, and storage backends (YAML, SQLite, MySQL).

- Version: 1.0.0
- Minecraft API: 1.20
- Features:
    - Personal backpack GUI with up to 6 rows based on permissions
    - Shortcut item (default BUNDLE) with dynamic preview
    - Auto-pickup to backpack when inventory is full
    - Auto-sort modes (OFF, LIGHT, AGGRESSIVE)
    - World and gamemode restrictions
    - Clear inventory commands with optional confirmation
    - Multi-backend storage (YAML, SQLite, MySQL) and migration tools
    - Language files with default merging
    - Update checker (optional)
    - API and events for developers
    - Duplication-safe interactions and content sanitization

Start with Installation, then learn Configuration, Commands, and Permissions. Server admins can choose Storage and run Migration. Developers can use the API and Events. See Troubleshooting and FAQ for common questions.
